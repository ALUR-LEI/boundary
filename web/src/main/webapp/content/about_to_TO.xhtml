                Using SOLA Community server you can <h:link outcome="user/registration">enrol</h:link> as a 
                Community Member and view land use recordings made by community members. 
                User enrolment can be done online and once you submit your enrolment request the Community Technologist
                will review it and approve. Upon approval a confirmation code will be sent to your e-mail address. 
                You will then need to activate your enrolment request, by following the received link. 
                Another way is to contact your Community Technologist and they will enroll 
                you as a user. 
                <p></p>
                All Community Member enrolment requests are subject to review and approval by the Community Server Technologist 
                and the Community Moderation Committee.
                <p></p>
                If you are already registered, use <h:link outcome="login">Login page</h:link> to login into the system.
